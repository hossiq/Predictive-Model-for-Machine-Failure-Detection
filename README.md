# Predictive-Model-for-Machine-Failure-Detection

**Background**

Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0) represents the current trend of automation and data exchange in manufacturing and other industries, integrating cyber-physical systems, the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, big data, and cognitive computing.Smart monitoring of manufacturing assets plays a critical role in enhancing operational efficiency and optimizing key performance indicators such as Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF), Mean Time to Repair (MTTR), and Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE).The proactive detection of machine failure is essential to mitigating downtime costs and sustaining manufacturing productivity

**Objective**

The project proposes an intelligent monitoring system that employs advanced machine learning techniques to analyze sensor data from the machines, Which eventually can be applied for Reduction in Unscheduled Downtime and Optimization of Maintenance Schedules.

**Data Collection, Analysis, and Processing**

A Water Pump data is collected from the Kaggle website https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nphantawee/pump-sensor-data for this study. This study used three months of data April, May, and June of 2018. Dataset contains 52 sensors , Timestamp by Minute, and Machine Status. I replace columns with nulls with mean value and dropped duplicates.
